# Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP)
This project implements a Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) Solver using a Nearest Neighbor approach. The goal is to find a path that visits all the cities exactly once and returns to the starting city, minimizing the total distance traveled.

## Problem Description
The TSP is a classic algorithmic problem in the field of computer science and operations research. The objective is to determine the shortest possible route that visits each city exactly once and returns to the original city.

#### Example
For the following distance matrix:
[
    [0, 2, 3, 20, 1],
    [2, 0, 15, 2, 20],
    [3, 15, 0, 20, 13],
    [20, 2, 20, 0, 9],
    [1, 20, 13, 9, 0]
]

The TSP solution would be a path that visits all cities exactly once and returns to the start, with the total distance minimized.

## How to Run
To run the script, simply execute the following into your terminal: python TSP.py
